The SmartHome "U-Power" Utility Token will allow for incentivizing homeowners to use a smart meter to provide energy data. The homeowner will have a smart phone that has a DApp created to provide current home energy data, allow for distributed power usage, and incentivize the homeowner. The smart meter will allow the utility company with stored energy from the homeowner's distributed energy system to the electric grid at critical peak times rewarding the homeowner with tokens and discounted return rates.
